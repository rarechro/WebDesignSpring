*I decided to go with inline js and css because external js was not working properly*

index.html makes up the entirety of this project. It builds a table based on user inputs and displays them.
The JS in index.html ensures the data is loaded then stops the website from refreshing which is a defailt attribute of the submit button on forms.
this allows me to extract the user input from the form and build a table around the information.
I then append the table to the body of the html page with the users data.
styles.css was not used in this project.*I used inline CSS*
